Plastic Waste Classification using CNN:
Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) is a deep learning model used to classify images of plastic waste.
Overview:
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of plastic waste. The model is trained on labeled images to assist in automated waste classification.
Tech Stack:
-Python
-TensorFlow/Keras
-OpenCV
-NumPy, Pandas
-Matplotlib, Seaborn
Dataset: The dataset used for this project is a collection of images of different types of waste. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets.
Installation and Usage:
1. First, download the project to your local machine using Git:
2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
3. Install the required Python libraries using requirements.txt: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Prepare the Dataset: Download or place the dataset inside the project folder
5. Train the model: python train.py
6. Test the model: python test.py
7. Evaluate the model: python evaluate.py
Model Architecture:
The CNN model includes multiple layers such as; conv2D layers, pooling layers, dropout layer, Dense layer, MaxPooling2D layer and Flatten layer.
